                <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The central feature of ReciPlan is its sophisticated AI recipe generation engine. This engine takes various user inputs and crafts unique, tailored recipes:

                        Users simply input the ingredients they currently have on hand. The AI processes this list, cross-referencing it with a vast database of culinary knowledge to propose recipes that maximally utilize the provided items. This is a core mechanism for reducing food waste.

                        The AI adapts its recipe suggestions based on a comprehensive range of user-defined dietary restrictions (e.g., Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Keto, Dairy-Free, Nut-Free) and meal preferences (e.g., cuisine type, cooking style, quick meals). This ensures that every generated recipe aligns perfectly with the user's health goals and tastes.

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The Health Tracker aims to transform ReciPlan from just a recipe generator into a comprehensive dietary wellness companion. It will integrate nutritional data directly into the recipe generation and meal planning process. This involves:

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-4">
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Nutritional Database:</strong> A robust backend database containing detailed nutritional information for a vast array of ingredients and common dishes.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">AI-Driven Analysis:</strong> When a recipe is generated or selected, the AI will calculate its nutritional profile (calories, macronutrients, key vitamins/minerals) based on ingredients and portion sizes.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Goal Setting & Monitoring:</strong> Users will be able to set personal dietary goals (e.g., daily calorie targets, protein intake, limits on sugar/fat, specific allergen avoidance). The tracker will then monitor their intake against these goals for meals logged through ReciPlan.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Historical Data & Trends:</strong> The system will store logged meal data, allowing users to view their nutritional history, identify patterns, and track progress over time through intuitive charts and summaries.</li>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 mt-6">Benefits:</h4>

                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Informed Food Choices:</strong> Empower users to understand the nutritional impact of their meals, leading to healthier eating habits.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Personalized Wellness:</strong> Tailor recipe suggestions not just by ingredients and preferences, but also by health goals, directly contributing to weight management, athletic performance, or managing specific health conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Allergen Safety:</strong> Critical for users with allergies or sensitivities, providing immediate alerts for potentially harmful ingredients in recipes.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Motivation & Accountability:</strong> Visual progress reports can serve as a powerful motivator, helping users stay accountable to their dietary objectives.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Reduced Reliance on Multiple Apps:</strong> Consolidate recipe management and basic health tracking into one platform.</li>

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Within their ReciPlan profile, users would input their health goals, dietary restrictions, and allergies. When generating a recipe, they would see an immediate nutritional summary. Post-meal, they could quickly log their consumption, and the Health Tracker would update their daily/weekly progress, showing visual dashboards of their intake relative to their targets.

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    This feature acknowledges that even the most dedicated home cooks sometimes need a break or require ingredients not on hand. The Zomato integration will provide a seamless bridge between ReciPlan's meal planning and the convenience of food delivery.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-8 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-4">
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Contextual Ordering Links:</strong> If a user is viewing a recipe that requires a specific ingredient they lack, or if they decide at the last minute not to cook, ReciPlan could offer a direct link to Zomato to order that ingredient (if available for delivery) or to find restaurants offering similar dishes.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Preference-Based Discovery:</strong> Leveraging a user's ReciPlan dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, specific cuisines), the integration can intelligently suggest relevant Zomato restaurants or dishes that align with their established tastes.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Quick Switch Mechanism:</strong> A prominent "Order from Zomato" button or similar call-to-action would be available within certain contexts, allowing for a rapid transition to the Zomato app or website with pre-filled search queries.</li>

                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Ultimate Flexibility:</strong> Provides users with a convenient alternative when cooking isn't feasible or desired, without leaving the ReciPlan ecosystem.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Time-Saving:</strong> Reduces the friction of switching between apps and manually searching for relevant food options.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Enhanced Convenience:</strong> Acts as a helpful "Plan B" for mealtime, ensuring users can always find a solution for their hunger, whether it's cooking or ordering.</li>
                    <li><strong class="font-semibold">Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Leverage ReciPlan's understanding of user preferences to suggest takeout options that genuinely appeal to them.</li>

                <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    A user browsing a recipe for, say, "Chicken Curry" might see an option pop up: "Don't have chicken? Order chicken curry from Zomato!" Or, when creating a meal plan, they could easily mark a day as "Order Out" and ReciPlan could suggest Zomato options based on their favorite cuisines or past ordered dishes. The transition would be smooth, either opening the Zomato app directly to a search result or redirecting to the Zomato website.

Notifications are triggered by Apex calls to the WhatsApp API.
